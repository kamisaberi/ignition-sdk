# This GitHub Actions workflow defines our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.
# It runs automatically on every push and pull request to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

      # 1. Check out the source code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # 2. Set up Node.js and Yarn (for our monorepo tooling)
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install root dependencies
        run: yarn install

      # 3. Set up Python
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4

          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install Python build tools
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt # A hypothetical root requirements file for dev tools

      # 4. Set up C++ build environment (install CMake, compilers, etc.)
      # This would be a more complex step in a real project, potentially
      # installing CUDA and TensorRT in the CI runner.
      - name: Set up C++ environment
        run: echo "Setting up build tools..." # Placeholder

      # 5. Run the build for the entire monorepo
      # This single command, orchestrated by Turborepo, will build all C++
      # libraries and all language packages in the correct order.
      - name: Build all packages
        run: yarn build

      # 6. Run the tests for the entire monorepo
      # This will run C++ tests, Python tests, Rust tests, etc.
      - name: Run all tests
        run: yarn test
